# vote-list-reader

Create an app that takes the 5 most voted stories from Hacker News (use their public API) and display them in a scrollable list. Show the name of the story and a read more link as well as the upvotes.

Make sure itâ€™s easy to read on mobile. Add dark mode too, in case I want to read at night.

Let me filter the stories based on some search keywords so I can filter by topics that interest me.
